# pop-quiz-repoCoding Quiz Challenge
Welcome to the Coding Quiz Challenge! In this game, you will be tested on your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals through a series of multiple-choice questions. The quiz is timed, and answering a question incorrectly will subtract time from the clock. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. You will then have the opportunity to save your initials and score.
